## Overview

Logic Field Theory (LFT) is a foundational program in quantum theory. It treats the **Three Fundamental Laws of Logic** (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) as primitive constraints from which physics necessarily emerges.

Instead of taking quantum mechanics as a starting postulate, LFT derives its structure from logic itself:

- **Complex numbers** arise as the unique scalar field consistent with logical orientation.
- **Gauge structure** U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3) follows from enhancing discrete logical symmetries.
- **Born rule** |c|² is derived via logical path counting.
- **Decoherence scaling** τ_D ∝ 1/ξ² emerges from constraint density in 3D.
- **Lagrangian dynamics** appear as the minimal framework preserving logical consistency.

---

The project combines **derivation papers**, **formal Lean 4 proofs**, and **AI-assisted theorem proving** to construct a fully verifiable framework.

## Derivation Flow

The seven core derivations (D01–D07) build on one another as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR
  D01["D01 • Admissible Graphs"] --> D02["D02 • Complex Necessity"]
  D01 --> D03["D03 • Gauge Structure"]
  D02 --> D03
  D03 --> D04["D04 • Born Rule"]
  D03 --> D05["D05 • Decoherence Scaling"]
  D04 --> D07["D07 • Predictions"]
  D05 --> D07
  D06["D06 • Lagrangian Formalism"] --> D07
```

## Progress

**Derivations (D01–D07):**
- **D01** – Defined admissible graphs and logical equivalence classes. Complexity O(n³).
- **D02** – Proved necessity of ℂ over ℝ or ℍ using representation theory.
- **D03** – Derived unitary evolution and gauge groups from logical symmetries.
- **D04** – Obtained the Born rule uniquely from path counting.
- **D05** – Connected logical strain to decoherence scaling (τ_D ∝ 1/ξ²).
- **D06** – Showed variational principles follow from logical consistency.
- **D07** – Outlined falsifiable predictions and experimental pathways.

**Philosophical foundation:** Published companion paper framing logic as ontological primitive.

**Formal verification:** Lean 4 proofs underway for D01–D04, with scaffolding for later derivations.
