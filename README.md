## Overview

Logic Field Theory (LFT) demonstrates that quantum mechanics emerges necessarily from the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle). This repository contains the complete theoretical framework, mathematical derivations, and Lean 4 formal verification.

## Key Results

- **Complex numbers are logically necessary** - First derivation showing ℂ is required, not chosen
- **Standard Model gauge structure** - U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3) emerges from logical constraints  
- **Born rule derived** - P = |ψ|² follows from path counting, not postulated
- **Exactly 3 fermion generations** - Proven from Z₂→S₃ embedding combinatorics
- **Measurement problem solved** - Strain threshold mechanism replaces collapse

## Experimental Prediction

**Critical Test**: Decoherence time scaling
- **LFT predicts**: τ_D ∝ (ξ/ℓ₀)² (positive exponent)
- **Standard QM predicts**: τ_D ∝ ξ⁻¹ (negative exponent)

These opposite signs provide an unambiguous experimental test.
