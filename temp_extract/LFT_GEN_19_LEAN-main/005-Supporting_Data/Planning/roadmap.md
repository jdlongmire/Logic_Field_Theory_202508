## Phase 1 â€“ Theory Refinement (In Progress)
- [x] Establish repo structure (`docs/theory-v5`, `docs/derivations-v5`, `lean-map`, `planning`)
- [x] Upload historical position papers and prior versions
- [x] Draft README with licensing, contact, and Zenodo link
- [x] Finalize `project-charter.md` and publish in `planning/`
- [ ] Complete merge of session notes into `theory-v5` narrative
- [ ] Begin migration of derivations into `derivations-v5`
- [ ] Set up AI review board (Claude, Grok, Gemini)

**Deliverables:**
- Theory narrative complete through Section 8
- Derivations complete for complex necessity, unitary evolution, Born rule

---

## Phase 2 â€“ Lean 4 Formalization
- [ ] Build clean Lean install with best perfomance practices
- [ ] Map theory sections to Lean modules in `lean-map/map.md`
- [ ] Implement graph-theoretic logic layer in Lean
- [ ] Formalize admissibility and logical strain definitions
- [ ] Derive complex state space and unitarity in Lean
- [ ] Implement Born rule derivation in Lean

**Deliverables:**
- Verified Lean proofs for Sections 2â€“6 of the theory
- Admissibility and strain modules reusable in other projects

---

## Phase 3 â€“ Predictive Testing
- [ ] Define strain-based falsifiable predictions
- [ ] Identify compatible experimental platforms (e.g., IBM Quantum)
- [ ] Design test protocols for null outcomes and strain scaling
- [ ] Publish experimental proposal paper

**Deliverables:**
- Publicly archived prediction set with parameters
- Submission to experimental collaborators

---

## Phase 4 â€“ Outreach & Publication
- [ ] Submit full theory paper to arXiv / relevant journal
- [ ] Publish Lean formalization in open repository
- [ ] Host recorded seminar on LFT foundations and results
- [ ] Continue iterative improvements based on peer feedback
