## Abstract

We provide the algorithmic foundations of Logic Field Theory by proving key properties of the logic operator 𝕃, establishing computational complexity bounds, and constructing the equivalence classes that form the basis of quantum state space. These results ground the abstract logical framework in concrete, computable procedures.

## 1. The Syntactic Space and Logic Operator

### 1.1 Formal Definitions

**Definition D1.1 (Syntactic Configuration).** A syntactic configuration is a triple G = (V, E, τ) where:
- V ⊂ ℒ is a finite set of literals from propositions 𝒫 = {p₁, p₂, ...}
- E ⊆ V × V is a set of directed edges (implications)
- τ: V → V is an involution satisfying τ(τ(v)) = v (negation map)

The syntactic space is:
$$\mathcal{S} = \{G = (V, E, \tau) : |V| < \infty\}$$

**Definition D1.2 (Logic Operator).** The operator 𝕃: 𝒮 → 𝒮 filters configurations by the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic:

$$\mathbb{L}(G) = \begin{cases}
G & \text{if } G \text{ satisfies (L1), (L2), (L3)} \\
\emptyset & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

where:
- **(L1) Identity:** ∀v ∈ V: (v,v) ∈ E
- **(L2) Non-Contradiction:** ∀v ∈ V: ∄ path v →* τ(v)
- **(L3) Excluded Middle:** ∀v ∈ V: τ(v) ∈ V

### 1.2 Properties of the Logic Operator

**Theorem D1.1 (Logic Operator Properties).** The operator 𝕃 satisfies:
1. **Contractive:** 𝕃(G) ∈ {G, ∅}
2. **Idempotent:** 𝕃(𝕃(G)) = 𝕃(G)
3. **Monotone:** If H ⊆ G (subgraph), then 𝕃(H) ⊆ 𝕃(G)

*Proof:*

**(1) Contractive:** By definition, 𝕃 either returns G unchanged (if admissible) or ∅ (if inadmissible). No intermediate values exist.

**(2) Idempotent:** 
- If 𝕃(G) = G, then G satisfies (L1)-(L3), so 𝕃(G) = G again
- If 𝕃(G) = ∅, then 𝕃(∅) = ∅ (empty graph vacuously satisfies all conditions)

**(3) Monotone:** If H ⊆ G and H violates some condition, then G contains the same violation. Conversely, if G satisfies all conditions, H might still violate them. Thus 𝕃(H) ⊆ 𝕃(G). □

## 2. Algorithmic Implementation

### 2.1 Admissibility Checking Algorithm

**Algorithm D1.1 (Admissibility Check).**
```python
def is_admissible(G):
    """
    Check if graph G = (V, E, τ) is logically admissible.
    Returns True if admissible, False otherwise.
    """
    V, E, tau = G.vertices, G.edges, G.negation
    
    # Check L1: Identity (self-loops)
    for v in V:
        if (v, v) not in E:
            return False  # Missing self-loop
    
    # Check L2: Non-Contradiction (no path to negation)
    for v in V:
        if exists_path(v, tau(v), E):
            return False  # Contradiction found
    
    # Check L3: Excluded Middle (negation pairs)
    for v in V:
        if tau(v) not in V:
            return False  # Incomplete negation pair
    
    return True  # All conditions satisfied

def exists_path(start, end, edges):
    """
    BFS to check if directed path exists from start to end.
    """
    if start == end:
        return True
    
    visited = set()
    queue = [start]
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        if current in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(current)
        
        # Find all vertices reachable from current
        for (u, v) in edges:
            if u == current:
                if v == end:
                    return True
                if v not in visited:
                    queue.append(v)
    
    return False
```

### 2.2 Complexity Analysis

**Theorem D1.2 (Computational Complexity).** Checking admissibility of G = (V, E, τ) has complexity O(|V|³).

*Proof:*

Let n = |V| and m = |E|.

**(L1) Identity check:** O(n) - single pass through vertices

**(L2) Non-Contradiction check:**
- For each vertex v: run BFS to check path to τ(v)
- BFS complexity: O(n + m) = O(n²) worst case (complete graph)
- Total: n × O(n²) = O(n³)

**(L3) Excluded Middle check:** O(n) - single pass through vertices

**Total complexity:** O(n) + O(n³) + O(n) = O(n³) = O(|V|³) □

### 2.3 Improved Algorithm for Sparse Graphs

**Algorithm D1.2 (Optimized for Sparse Graphs).**
```python
def is_admissible_optimized(G):
    """
    Optimized for graphs with m << n².
    Complexity: O(n(n + m)) instead of O(n³).
    """
    V, E, tau = G.vertices, G.edges, G.negation
    
    # Build adjacency list (O(m))
    adj = {v: [] for v in V}
    for (u, v) in E:
        adj[u].append(v)
    
    # Check all conditions
    for v in V:
        # L1: Identity
        if v not in adj[v]:
            return False
        
        # L3: Excluded Middle
        if tau(v) not in V:
            return False
        
        # L2: Non-Contradiction (optimized BFS)
        if bfs_path_exists(v, tau(v), adj):
            return False
    
    return True

def bfs_path_exists(start, end, adj):
    """BFS using adjacency list."""
    if start == end:
        return True
    
    visited = {start}
    queue = [start]
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        for neighbor in adj[current]:
            if neighbor == end:
                return True
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return False
```

## 3. Construction of Equivalence Classes

### 3.1 Logical Equivalence

**Definition D1.3 (Logical Equivalence).** Two admissible graphs G, H ∈ 𝒜 are logically equivalent (G ∼ H) if they encode the same logical constraints:

$$G \sim H \iff \forall \phi: \mathcal{P} \to \{0,1\}, \text{Sat}(G,\phi) = \text{Sat}(H,\phi)$$

where Sat(G,φ) indicates whether truth assignment φ satisfies G's implications.

### 3.2 Equivalence Class Algorithm

**Algorithm D1.3 (Equivalence Class Construction).**
```python
def construct_equivalence_classes(admissible_graphs):
    """
    Partition admissible graphs into equivalence classes.
    Returns list of equivalence classes.
    """
    classes = []
    processed = set()
    
    for G in admissible_graphs:
        if G in processed:
            continue
        
        # Start new equivalence class
        equiv_class = [G]
        processed.add(G)
        
        # Find all graphs equivalent to G
        for H in admissible_graphs:
            if H not in processed and are_equivalent(G, H):
                equiv_class.append(H)
                processed.add(H)
        
        classes.append(equiv_class)
    
    return classes

def are_equivalent(G, H):
    """
    Check if graphs G and H are logically equivalent.
    """
    # Extract propositional variables
    props_G = extract_propositions(G)
    props_H = extract_propositions(H)
    
    if props_G != props_H:
        return False
    
    # Check all 2^n truth assignments
    n = len(props_G)
    for assignment in range(2**n):
        phi = decode_assignment(assignment, props_G)
        if satisfies(G, phi) != satisfies(H, phi):
            return False
    
    return True
```

### 3.3 Canonical Representatives

**Theorem D1.3 (Canonical Form).** Each equivalence class [G] has a unique minimal representative G_min with:
1. Minimum number of edges
2. Lexicographically first among minimal edge sets

*Proof:* Well-ordering of finite sets ensures uniqueness. Minimality preserves logical content. □

**Algorithm D1.4 (Canonical Representative).**
```python
def canonical_representative(equiv_class):
    """
    Find minimal canonical graph representing the class.
    """
    # Start with any graph in class
    G = equiv_class[0]
    V, E, tau = G.vertices, G.edges, G.negation
    
    # Remove redundant edges
    E_minimal = E.copy()
    for edge in E:
        if edge[0] == edge[1]:  # Keep self-loops (L1)
            continue
        
        # Try removing edge
        E_test = E_minimal - {edge}
        G_test = (V, E_test, tau)
        
        if is_admissible(G_test) and preserves_implications(G, G_test):
            E_minimal = E_test
    
    # Sort edges lexicographically
    E_canonical = sorted(E_minimal)
    
    return (V, E_canonical, tau)
```

## 4. Enumeration and Counting

### 4.1 Counting Admissible Graphs

**Theorem D1.4 (Growth Rate).** The number of admissible graphs with n proposition pairs grows as:
$$|\mathcal{A}_n| = 2^{O(n^2)}$$

*Proof:*
- Total possible graphs: 2^(4n²) (each of 2n vertices can connect to 2n vertices)
- Constraints remove fraction but not exponential growth
- Self-loops required: reduces by factor 2^(2n)
- Non-contradiction: eliminates graphs with v→τ(v) paths
- Net effect: Still exponential in n² □

### 4.2 Efficient Enumeration

**Algorithm D1.5 (Admissible Graph Generator).**
```python
def generate_admissible_graphs(n):
    """
    Generate all admissible graphs with n proposition pairs.
    Uses backtracking to prune invalid branches early.
    """
    # Create vertex set
    V = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        V.extend([f"p{i}", f"~p{i}"])
    
    # Define negation map
    tau = {}
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        tau[f"p{i}"] = f"~p{i}"
        tau[f"~p{i}"] = f"p{i}"
    
    # Start with required self-loops (L1)
    E_required = {(v, v) for v in V}
    
    # Generate all valid edge sets
    admissible = []
    possible_edges = [(u, v) for u in V for v in V if (u, v) not in E_required]
    
    def backtrack(E_current, remaining_edges):
        G = (V, E_current, tau)
        
        # Check current graph
        if not has_contradiction_path(G):
            admissible.append(G.copy())
        
        # Try adding more edges
        for i, edge in enumerate(remaining_edges):
            E_new = E_current | {edge}
            
            # Prune if edge creates contradiction
            if edge[0] != tau[edge[1]]:  # Don't add direct contradictions
                backtrack(E_new, remaining_edges[i+1:])
    
    backtrack(E_required, possible_edges)
    return admissible
```

## 5. Special Cases and Examples

### 5.1 Minimal Admissible Graphs

**Example D1.1 (Smallest Non-Trivial Admissible Graph).**
```
G_min = ({p, ¬p}, {(p,p), (¬p,¬p)}, τ)
```
- Two vertices (one proposition pair)
- Only self-loops (minimum for L1)
- No paths between p and ¬p (satisfies L2)
- Both p and τ(p) present (satisfies L3)

### 5.2 Maximal Admissible Graphs

**Example D1.2 (Maximal Without Contradiction).**
```
G_max = ({p, ¬p, q, ¬q}, E_max, τ)
E_max = {all edges except those creating paths v→τ(v)}
```

Key insight: Can have p→q and ¬q→¬p simultaneously (contrapositive), but not p→¬p.

### 5.3 Equivalence Class Examples

**Example D1.3 (Distinct Graphs, Same Class).**
```
G1: p→q, q→r, p→r (direct + transitive)
G2: p→q, q→r (minimal, implies p→r)
```
Both represent same logical constraint: G1 ∼ G2.

## 6. Optimization Techniques

### 6.1 Parallel Admissibility Checking

**Algorithm D1.6 (Parallel Non-Contradiction Check).**
```python
def parallel_check_non_contradiction(G, num_threads=4):
    """
    Parallelize the O(n³) non-contradiction check.
    """
    import concurrent.futures
    
    V, E, tau = G.vertices, G.edges, G.negation
    vertices = list(V)
    chunk_size = len(vertices) // num_threads
    
    def check_chunk(vertex_chunk):
        for v in vertex_chunk:
            if exists_path(v, tau(v), E):
                return False
        return True
    
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_threads) as executor:
        futures = []
        for i in range(num_threads):
            start = i * chunk_size
            end = start + chunk_size if i < num_threads - 1 else len(vertices)
            chunk = vertices[start:end]
            futures.append(executor.submit(check_chunk, chunk))
        
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            if not future.result():
                return False
    
    return True
```

### 6.2 Incremental Admissibility

**Theorem D1.5 (Incremental Checking).** When adding edge e to admissible graph G:
- L1 unchanged (self-loops unaffected)
- L3 unchanged (vertex set unaffected)
- L2 only needs checking for new paths through e

*Complexity:* O(n²) instead of O(n³) for full recheck.

## 7. Connection to Quantum State Space

### 7.1 Basis Construction

**Theorem D1.6 (Basis Correspondence).** The equivalence classes [G] ∈ 𝒜/∼ form an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space ℋ = ℓ²(𝒜/∼, ℂ).

*Proof:* By construction in Section 4, each [G] corresponds to a distinct logical configuration, and the combinatorial pairing gives orthonormality. □

### 7.2 Dimension Counting

**Corollary D1.1 (Hilbert Space Dimension).** For n proposition pairs:
$$\dim \mathcal{H}_n \leq 2^{4n^2}$$

with equality only if all graphs were admissible (impossible for n ≥ 1).

## 8. Computational Resources

### 8.1 Memory Requirements

**Theorem D1.7 (Space Complexity).** Storing all admissible graphs with n propositions requires:
$$\text{Memory} = O(n \cdot 2^{n^2}) \text{ bits}$$

*Proof:* Each graph needs O(n²) bits for edges, O(n) for vertices. With 2^O(n²) admissible graphs, total is O(n·2^n²). □

### 8.2 Practical Limits

| Propositions | Max Graphs | Memory | Time (1 GHz) |
|--------------|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2 | ~10² | 1 KB | < 1 ms |
| 3 | ~10⁴ | 100 KB | < 1 s |
| 4 | ~10⁸ | 10 GB | ~ 1 hour |
| 5 | ~10¹⁶ | 1 EB | ~ 10⁹ years |

Practical computation limited to n ≤ 4 propositions without optimization.
