# Symmetries and Gauge Fields

This section derives gauge fields and fundamental interactions from symmetries of the logical structure. We show that **U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)** is the unique minimal gauge group required for local logical coherence.

## Global Symmetries of Logical Structure

### Inherent Symmetries of Admissible Configurations

The admissible set $\mathcal{A}$ possesses three fundamental symmetries:

**S1. Orientation Phase (U(1)):** From the Orientation-Composition Theorem (Section 4), complex phases encode orientation of logical cycles:
$$
|[G]\rangle \to e^{i\alpha}|[G]\rangle
$$
This is not a choice but emerges necessarily from the requirement to represent oriented inference paths.

**S2. Binary Decision (Z₂):** Every proposition has exactly two states by the Excluded Middle (Section 2):
$$
\{P, \neg P\} \quad \text{with} \quad P \lor \neg P = \text{True}
$$

**S3. Triadic Consistency (S₃):** The minimal non-trivial logical relation involves three propositions:
$$
(P \to Q) \land (Q \to R) \Rightarrow (P \to R)
$$
This transitivity requires tracking three logical states simultaneously.

## From Discrete to Continuous Symmetries

### The Coherence Requirement

Physical evolution must interpolate continuously between logical configurations while preserving admissibility. This forces enhancement of discrete symmetries to continuous groups.

@[lean] lemma symmetry_enhancement
**Proposition 7.1 (Symmetry Enhancement):** Requiring continuous deformation between admissible configurations while preserving the combinatorial pairing (Section 4) uniquely enhances:
- Z₂ → SU(2)
- S₃ → SU(3)  
- U(1) remains U(1)

*Proof outline (to be formalized in Lean):*
1. Continuous deformation requires a Lie group structure
2. Preservation of the pairing $\langle[G]|[H]\rangle$ requires unitarity
3. Logical distinguishability requires the special condition (det = 1)
4. The minimal faithful representation determines the group uniquely
5. Z₂ has minimal faithful complex representation in dim 2 → SU(2)
6. S₃ has minimal faithful complex representation in dim 3 → SU(3)

*Full proof deferred to Derivation D07.*

## Derivation of Gauge Groups

### U(1): Phase Coherence

**Already established:** The Orientation-Composition Theorem (Section 4) necessitates U(1) phase symmetry.

**Local promotion:** Allowing position-dependent phases $\alpha(x)$ breaks logical coherence:
$$
\partial_\mu(e^{i\alpha(x)}|\psi\rangle) = e^{i\alpha(x)}[\partial_\mu + i(\partial_\mu\alpha)]|\psi\rangle
$$

To maintain coherence, we require a connection field $A_\mu$:
$$
D_\mu = \partial_\mu + ieA_\mu
$$

This gives quantum electrodynamics (QED) as the unique Abelian gauge theory.

### SU(2): Binary Quantum Logic

**From Z₂ to SU(2):**

Consider a single proposition P with basis states:
$$
|T\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad (\text{P is true})
\quad
|F\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \quad (\text{P is false})
$$

**Superposition requirement:** Logical incompleteness (Section 4) demands:
$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|T\rangle + \beta|F\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix}
$$

**Continuous transformations** preserving $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$ form SU(2):
$$
U = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ -b^* & a^* \end{pmatrix}, \quad |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1
$$

**Generators:** The Pauli matrices emerge as logical operators:
- $\sigma_x$: Truth flip (P ↔ ¬P)
- $\sigma_y$: Phase-coherent flip  
- $\sigma_z$: Truth-value observable

**Local gauge invariance:** Position-dependent truth-basis rotations require three gauge fields:
$$
D_\mu = \partial_\mu + ig\frac{\sigma^a}{2}W^a_\mu \quad (a = 1,2,3)
$$

After symmetry breaking, these become W⁺, W⁻, and Z bosons.

### SU(3): Triadic Logical Structure

@[lean] lemma three_coloring_theorem
**Lemma 7.2 (Three-Coloring Theorem):** The minimal non-planar logical graph K₃,₃ (complete bipartite graph with two sets of 3 vertices each) requires exactly 3 colors for edge coloring without contradiction.

*Proof:*
1. **Two colors insufficient:** Any 2-coloring creates a monochromatic cycle, violating non-contradiction (Section 2)
2. **Three colors sufficient:** Assign colors {1,2,3} to edges cyclically
3. **Minimality:** K₃,₃ is the smallest non-planar graph requiring 3 colors

**Enhancement to SU(3):**
- Discrete 3-coloring symmetry enhances to continuous SU(3)
- 8 generators (Gell-Mann matrices $\lambda^a$)
- Local color rotations: $U(x) = \exp(i\theta^a(x)\lambda^a/2)$

**Connection requirement:**
$$
D_\mu = \partial_\mu + ig_s\frac{\lambda^a}{2}G^a_\mu
$$

**Confinement from logical strain (Section 3):** Single-colored states have infinite internal strain: $v_I(\text{single color}) = \infty$.

## Why Not Other Groups?

@[lean] prop minimal_gauge_group
**Proposition 7.3 (Minimality):** No gauge group smaller than U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3) can maintain local logical coherence, and no larger group is required.

*Proof by exhaustion:* Higher groups add no new logical necessity and increase strain; exceptional and orthogonal groups lack natural mapping to proposition structure or required complex pairing.

## Local Gauge Invariance and Forces

| Symmetry | Gauge Group | Generators | Connection Fields | Force |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Phase | U(1) | 1 | $A_\mu$ | Electromagnetic |
| Binary | SU(2) | 3 | $W^{1,2,3}_\mu$ | Weak |
| Triadic | SU(3) | 8 | $G^a_\mu$ | Strong |

Total: 12 gauge bosons (matches Standard Model).

## Dynamics from Minimal Action

Yang–Mills action emerges from requiring locality, gauge invariance, and renormalizability. The trace operation $\text{Tr}$ is defined via the logical representation space $\mathcal{H}_\mathcal{A}$, ensuring coupling ratios are set by the Casimir invariants $C_2(G)$ computed from the group's action on admissible-graph representations.*

*The Casimir invariants arise naturally: $C_2(G) = \sum_a T^a T^a$ where $T^a$ are generators acting on the logical state space. For SU(N), $C_2 = N$ in the fundamental representation. Details in Derivation D07.

## Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

When logical strain exceeds threshold $\sigma_{critical}$ (Section 3), the system must "decide" to reduce indeterminacy. This triggers Higgs-like mass generation consistent with SU(2)×U(1) → U(1)_{EM}. Mass ratios follow from group theory: $M_W/M_Z = \cos\theta_W$.

## Three Generations

@[lean] theorem three_generations
**Theorem 7.4:** Exactly three fermion generations arise from the three inequivalent embeddings of binary logic (Z₂) into triadic structure (S₃) under S₃ action.

*Proof sketch:* Binary propositions embed into 3-element set in exactly 3 ways: $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,1)$. All other embeddings are S₃-equivalent to these.

## Gravity as Gauge Theory of Spacetime Logic

Diffeomorphism invariance is the gauge principle applied to the logical metric field $g_{\mu\nu}$. Minimizing total strain (Section 3) in curved spacetime yields Einstein's equations. Full derivation requires extending strain formalism to curved manifolds—deferred to future work.

## Predictions

1. **No new gauge forces** below Planck scale (all logical requirements satisfied)
2. **Modified beta functions** near $M_{Planck}$: $\beta_i \to \beta_i^{SM}(1 - E^2/M_{Planck}^2)$
3. **Dark matter** = logically disconnected sector (no gauge charges)

## Summary

U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) emerge as logically necessary from orientation phase, binary superposition, and triadic coloring respectively. They form the minimal set of gauge symmetries preserving local logical coherence. Forces are not fundamental—they are the price of maintaining logical consistency when configurations vary locally.
