# D06 - Experimental Validation of Logical Foundations

## Abstract

We propose experiments to test whether physical systems obey the logical consistency requirements derived in D01-D05. Rather than assuming quantum mechanics, we test whether: (1) all observed states correspond to admissible graphs satisfying the 3FLL, (2) the consistency breakdown rate scales as ξ² as derived, and (3) the probability measure for outcomes matches the path-counting derivation. These tests validate that physics emerges from logical necessity.

## 1. Testing Framework

### 1.1 What We're Testing

**The core claim:** Physical reality consists only of logically admissible configurations.

**Specific predictions from pure logic:**
1. All states satisfy the Three Fundamental Laws
2. Underdetermined states require complex representation (D02)
3. Consistency breakdown rate ∝ ξ² (D05)
4. Outcome probabilities follow |c|² rule (D04)

### 1.2 Falsifiability Criteria

**This framework is falsifiable by:**
- Finding states that violate the 3FLL
- Observing different scaling than ξ²
- Measuring probabilities that don't match path counting
- Discovering errors in our derivations

**This framework is NOT falsifiable by:**
- Violations of what physicists call "quantum mechanics"
- Philosophical objections to logic itself
- Alternative interpretations of the same mathematics

## 2. Test Category 1: Logical Admissibility of Physical States

### 2.1 Graph Representation Test

**Hypothesis:** Every physical state can be mapped to an admissible graph G = (V, E, τ).

**Protocol:**
1. Prepare various physical states
2. Map to graph representation:
   - Vertices = logical propositions
   - Edges = logical relationships
   - τ = negation operator
3. Verify all satisfy:
   - Identity: v = v for all vertices
   - Non-Contradiction: No paths from v to both w and τ(w)
   - Excluded Middle: For each pair (v, τ(v)), determined relationships

**Expected Result:** 100% of physical states pass admissibility check.

### 2.2 Constraint Counting Verification

**Test:** Verify that the number of logical constraints scales as predicted.

**Protocol:**
1. Systems of varying size ξ
2. Count independent constraints:
   - Identity constraints: N_I ∝ (ξ/ℓ₀)³
   - Non-contradiction checks: N_NC ∝ (ξ/ℓ₀)⁶
   - Excluded middle requirements: N_EM ∝ (ξ/ℓ₀)³
3. Verify total scaling

**Prediction:** Total constraints scale as (ξ/ℓ₀)⁶.

## 3. Test Category 2: Underdetermined States

### 3.1 Complex Structure Necessity

**From D02:** Underdetermined states with oriented logical cycles require complex coefficients.

**Test Protocol:**
1. Create states with logical cycles
2. Attempt representation with:
   - Real numbers only
   - Complex numbers
   - Quaternions
3. Check which preserves:
   - Cycle orientation
   - Independent subsystem property
   - Continuity of transformations

**Expected:** Only complex representation succeeds.

### 3.2 Linear Combination Structure

**Test:** Verify underdetermined states require linear combinations.

**Protocol:**
1. Prepare incompletely determined logical configuration
2. Show it corresponds to multiple admissible graphs
3. Verify representation requires: |ψ⟩ = Σᵢ cᵢ|Gᵢ⟩
4. Confirm coefficients are complex (from 3.1)

**Result:** Recover Hilbert space structure from pure logic.

## 4. Test Category 3: Consistency Breakdown Scaling

### 4.1 Size Dependence

**Core Prediction from D05:** τ_consistency ∝ 1/ξ²

**Test Systems:**
| System | Size ξ | Predicted Relative τ | Measured Relative τ |
|--------|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Electron | 10⁻¹⁰ m | 10²⁰ | ? |
| Atom | 10⁻⁹ m | 10¹⁸ | ? |
| Molecule | 10⁻⁸ m | 10¹⁶ | ? |
| Nanoparticle | 10⁻⁷ m | 10¹⁴ | ? |
| Dust grain | 10⁻⁶ m | 10¹² | ? |

**Protocol:**
1. Prepare underdetermined states of each size
2. Measure time to forced determination
3. Plot log(τ) vs log(ξ)
4. Verify slope = -2

### 4.2 Environmental Density Dependence

**Prediction:** τ_consistency ∝ 1/n_env

**Test:**
1. Fix system size ξ
2. Vary environmental density (pressure)
3. Measure consistency breakdown time
4. Verify inverse proportionality

## 5. Test Category 4: Path Counting and Probabilities

### 5.1 Born Rule from Logic

**From D04:** Probability = |path amplitude|²

**Test Protocol:**
1. Prepare underdetermined state with known coefficients
2. Force determination (measurement)
3. Repeat many times
4. Verify probability distribution matches |cₖ|²

**Critical:** We're not assuming Born rule; we're testing if path counting gives correct probabilities.

### 5.2 Interference from Path Combination

**Logical Prediction:** Paths with opposite orientation cancel.

**Test:**
1. Create configuration with two logical paths to same outcome
2. Vary relative orientation (phase)
3. Measure probability vs orientation
4. Verify interference pattern

**Expected:** P = |c₁ + c₂|² = |c₁|² + |c₂|² + 2Re(c₁*c₂)

## 6. Test Category 5: Information-Theoretic Bounds

### 6.1 Logical Information Capacity

**Hypothesis:** Information capacity limited by number of admissible graphs.

**Test:**
1. Count admissible graphs for system size ξ
2. Attempt to encode more information
3. Verify failure when exceeding logical capacity

**Expected:** Capacity = log₂(N_admissible)

### 6.2 Consistency-Preserving Operations

**From D03:** Only certain transformations preserve admissibility.

**Test:**
1. Apply various transformations to admissible graphs
2. Check which preserve:
   - All three laws
   - Graph connectivity
   - Cycle orientation
3. Verify these form unitary group

**Result:** Derive allowed dynamics from logic.

## 7. Critical Distinguishing Tests

### 7.1 Logic vs Quantum Mechanics

**Key Question:** Are we just rediscovering QM or explaining it?

**Test:** Look for logical patterns beyond standard QM:
1. Logical correlations in measurement sequences
2. Graph complexity metrics predicting stability
3. Information bounds from admissibility

**Expected:** Same numerical predictions, deeper structure visible.

### 7.2 Universality Check

**Test across different physical systems:**
- Photons (bosons)
- Electrons (fermions)  
- Composite particles
- Macroscopic objects

**All should:**
1. Map to admissible graphs
2. Show ξ² scaling
3. Follow path-counting probabilities

## 8. Data Analysis Framework

### 8.1 Metrics to Track

For all tests, measure:
1. **Graph complexity:** Number of vertices and edges
2. **Constraint satisfaction:** Which of 3FLL are stressed
3. **Breakdown patterns:** How consistency fails
4. **Scaling exponents:** Actual vs predicted

### 8.2 Statistical Requirements

To distinguish our predictions with 5σ confidence:
- Minimum 10⁴ trials per configuration
- At least 6 orders of magnitude in ξ
- Environmental control to 0.1%
- Timing precision to 10⁻¹⁵ seconds

## 9. Expected Outcomes

### 9.1 Confirmations

All experiments should confirm:
1. **Every state is logically admissible**
2. **Scaling matches derivation:** τ ∝ 1/ξ²
3. **Probabilities follow path counting**
4. **Complex structure is necessary**

### 9.2 Deeper Understanding

Beyond confirmation, we gain:
- Why these specific mathematical structures
- Why these particular scaling laws
- Why measurement appears probabilistic
- Why large objects behave classically

## 10. The Validation Strategy

### 10.1 Progressive Testing

1. **First:** Verify admissibility mapping
2. **Then:** Test scaling predictions
3. **Next:** Validate probability rules
4. **Finally:** Explore information bounds

### 10.2 Cross-Validation

Each prediction should be tested:
- Multiple system types
- Various size scales
- Different environments
- Independent laboratories

## 11. Conclusion

These experiments test whether physics emerges from logical necessity. We're not testing quantum mechanics against logic—we're testing whether the mathematical structures physicists discovered (Hilbert spaces, complex amplitudes, Born rule) are the unique solutions to maintaining logical consistency in nature.

### The Core Validation

If confirmed, these tests establish:
1. Physical reality = logically admissible configurations
2. Quantum mechanics = necessary consequence of 3FLL
3. No alternative consistent physics possible
4. The "mysteries" of QM are logical requirements

### The Revolutionary Insight

We're not proposing new physics. We're showing that the physics we observe is the only physics logically possible. The experiments validate this necessity.
