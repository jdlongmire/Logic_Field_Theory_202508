- **Build Command**: `lake build Core.L0X_ModuleName`
- **Cache**: Mathlib cache successfully installed via `lake exe cache get`

## Core Thesis & Vision

### The Fundamental Claim
The Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) are not merely tools of reasoning but **prescriptive ontic constraints on physical reality itself**.

### The Falsifiability Criterion
**Simple and Clear**: Demonstrate a single reproducible instance where physical reality violates any of the 3FLL, and the theory is falsified.

## What We've Built in Lean 4

### L01_ThreeLogicLaws.lean
**Status**: Complete foundation, compiles cleanly

**Key Components**:
1. `State Œ±` - Abstract representation of possible states
2. Three laws formally defined as predicates
3. `LogicallyConsistent` - Bundle of all three laws
4. `PhysicalReality` - Set of logically consistent states

**Critical Insight**: In classical logic, all states trivially satisfy the 3FLL. This module establishes ground truth but doesn't yet constrain anything.

### L02_StateStructure.lean
**Status**: Structure added, compiles with `sorry` placeholders

**Key Components**:
1. `Property` - Observable properties (position, momentum, spin, energy)
2. `StructuredState` - States with properties that can conflict
3. `properties_conflict` - Formalization of incompatible properties
4. `StructuredPhysicalReality` - Only consistent states exist

**Breakthrough**: We now have states that **CAN** violate logic but **DON'T**. Physical reality is a proper subset of all possible states!

## Critical Lessons Learned

### 1. The Vacuity Problem & Solution
- **Problem**: In classical logic, the 3FLL are tautologies - everything satisfies them
- **Solution**: Add structure (properties) that can potentially conflict, making consistency non-trivial
- **Implementation**: L02 shows how uncertainty principle emerges as logical constraint

### 2. Lean 4 Best Practices
- Start with minimal imports, add as needed
- Use `sorry` placeholders to get structure right before proving
- Build incrementally: `lake build Core.L0X_ModuleName`
- File naming: L0X format in Core/ directory
- Always get Mathlib cache: `lake exe cache get`

### 3. The Correct Build Order
1. Establish formal foundations (L01) even if "trivial"
2. Add structure that makes constraints meaningful (L02)
3. Show dynamics must preserve consistency (planned L03)
4. Derive physical laws from consistency requirements (planned L04+)

### 4. Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- **Don't claim too much too fast**: We haven't derived Œ± = 1/137 yet
- **Acknowledge circularity**: We're using logic to prove logic is fundamental
- **Stay falsifiable**: Every claim must be testable
- **Build systematically**: Ground truth ‚Üí Structure ‚Üí Dynamics ‚Üí Predictions

## The Physics Connection (Emerging)

### What's Starting to Work
1. **Uncertainty as Logical Constraint**: Position and momentum can't both be definite (would violate logic)
2. **Measurement as Logic Enforcement**: Collapse ensures consistency
3. **Superposition as Pre-Logical**: Quantum states exist in "soft logic" regime

### What Still Needs Development
1. Precise mechanism for logical constraints ‚Üí forces
2. Derivation of specific constants from logic
3. Testable predictions differing from standard QM
4. Connection to gauge theory and Standard Model

## Next Immediate Steps

### L03_Evolution (Recommended Next Module)
```lean
-- Show that evolution must preserve logical consistency
-- This should lead to unitary evolution and Schr√∂dinger equation
```

### L04_Measurement
```lean
-- Formalize measurement as logical crystallization
-- Derive Born rule from consistency requirements
```

### L05_GaugeStructure
```lean
-- Show local logical consistency ‚Üí gauge fields
-- Connect to Standard Model structure
```

## Key Code Patterns Established

### Pattern 1: Structured Definitions
```lean
structure StructuredState (Œ± : Type*) where
  base : State Œ±
  properties : Set (Property Œ±)
```

### Pattern 2: Consistency Predicates
```lean
def StructuredConsistent (s : StructuredState Œ±) : Prop :=
  ‚àÄ (p q : Property Œ±), p ‚àà s.properties ‚Üí q ‚àà s.properties ‚Üí 
    ¬¨properties_conflict p q
```

### Pattern 3: Physical Reality as Consistent Subset
```lean
def StructuredPhysicalReality (Œ± : Type*) : Set (StructuredState Œ±) :=
  {s : StructuredState Œ± | StructuredConsistent s}
```

## Critical Open Questions

1. **The Uniqueness Problem**: Why U(1)√óSU(2)√óSU(3) specifically?
2. **The Constants Problem**: How exactly does logical distinguishability ‚Üí Œ± = 1/137?
3. **The Measurement Problem**: Is measurement really just logical crystallization?
4. **The Quantum Gravity Connection**: How do the 3FLL constrain spacetime itself?

## Repository Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Commit after each successful module
2. **Documentation**: Keep inline comments explaining physics intuition
3. **Proofs**: Use `sorry` to sketch structure, fill in proofs later
4. **Testing**: Always verify with `lake build` before moving on

## Philosophical Context

### What We're Really Attempting
Not just another interpretation of QM, but showing that physics IS applied logic - that the universe computes its next state using the unique evolution that preserves logical consistency.

### The Ultimate Goal
Derive all of physics from the single requirement: "Reality must be logically consistent."

## Handoff Instructions

1. **Clone/Pull Repository**: Get latest LFT_003_Lean_Proofs
2. **Build Mathlib Cache**: Run `lake exe cache get`
3. **Verify Current Modules**: 
   - `lake build Core.L01_ThreeLogicLaws`
   - `lake build Core.L02_StateStructure`
4. **Continue with L03**: Focus on evolution/dynamics
5. **Fill in Proofs**: Replace `sorry` with actual proofs
6. **Document Physics**: Explain each constraint's physical meaning

## Final Critical Insight

The key breakthrough is recognizing that logical consistency becomes non-trivial when states have structure. The 3FLL don't constrain point particles, but they DO constrain structured states with potentially conflicting properties. This is where physics emerges from logic.
