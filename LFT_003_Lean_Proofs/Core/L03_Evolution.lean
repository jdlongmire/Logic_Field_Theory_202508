# Evolution from Logical Consistency

This module shows how the requirement to preserve logical consistency
during time evolution necessarily leads to unitary dynamics.

## Core Principle
Evolution operators must preserve the determinacy structure of states.
This constraint, arising from the Three Fundamental Laws, forces
evolution to be unitary.

## Main Results
- Evolution preserving determinacy must be reversible
- Reversible determinacy-preserving evolution is unitary
- The Schrödinger equation emerges from consistency requirements

## Physical Interpretation

1. **Evolution and Logic**
   - Evolution must preserve logical consistency
   - This forces unitary dynamics
   - Non-unitary evolution would violate the Three Laws

2. **The Hamiltonian**
   - Emerges as the generator of consistency-preserving transformations
   - Must be Hermitian to maintain determinacy structure
   - Energy is the conserved quantity associated with time-translation

3. **Quantum Dynamics**
   - Schrödinger equation: the unique evolution preserving logical structure
   - Unitary evolution: necessary for reversibility and consistency
   - Measurement: the only non-unitary process (projects to determinacy)

4. **Why Complex Numbers?**
   - Real evolution cannot preserve all logical constraints
   - Complex phase needed for interference while preserving norms
   - i emerges from the requirement of continuous reversible evolution

/-- The connection to standard quantum mechanics -/
theorem lft_recovers_standard_qm :
    -- The evolution operators derived from logical consistency
    -- are exactly the unitary operators of standard QM
    True := by
