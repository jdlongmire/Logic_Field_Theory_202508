# The Probable to Actual Transition: The Foundation of Logic Field Theory

This module formalizes the core insight of LFT: Quantum mechanics is the mathematical
description of how logical possibilities become physical actualities through strain relief.

## Core Principle
Physical Reality emerges from Logical Possibility Space through a process of strain relief
that transforms probable states into actual states while maintaining the Three Fundamental Laws.

## Key Concepts
- **Logical Strain**: The tension from avoiding infinite precision (which would violate logic)
- **Probable States**: High-strain superpositions existing in possibility space
- **Actual States**: Low-strain eigenstates manifested in Physical Reality
- **Actualization**: The strain relief process that transitions probable → actual

## The Deep Truth

Physical Reality is where logical possibilities have actualized through strain relief.

**Probable (Potentia)**: High-strain superposition states in Logical Space
**Actual (Reality)**: Low-strain eigenstates in Physical Reality
**Measurement**: The gateway triggering strain relief and actualization

This resolves the measurement problem: measurement doesn't "collapse" anything,
it triggers the strain relief that enables the probable→actual transition.

The wave function doesn't describe what IS, but what COULD BE if actualized.
Quantum mechanics is the precise mathematical description of how logical
possibilities become physical actualities while maintaining consistency with
the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic.
