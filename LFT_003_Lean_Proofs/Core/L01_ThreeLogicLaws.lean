# The Three Fundamental Laws of Logic as Physical Constraints

This module establishes the foundational framework for Logic Field Theory (LFT).
We define the Three Fundamental Laws and show how they constrain possible states.

## Main Definitions
- `State` - An abstract representation of a possible state in reality
- `satisfies_identity` - The Identity Law for states
- `satisfies_noncontradiction` - The Non-Contradiction Law for predicates
- `satisfies_excluded_middle` - The Excluded Middle Law for predicates
- `LogicallyConsistent` - States that satisfy all three laws
- `PhysicalReality` - The subset of states that are logically consistent

## Key Observations

While these results seem trivial in classical logic, they establish important facts:

1. The 3FLL are not independent - in classical logic, they're all theorems
2. Every conceivable state satisfies the 3FLL in our framework
3. The interesting physics must come from additional structure on states

The next step will be to add structure (quantum amplitudes, spacetime positions, etc.)
and see how the 3FLL constrain the dynamics and interactions of these structured states.

/-- Two states are logically equivalent if they satisfy the same predicates -/
def logically_equivalent (s₁ s₂ : State α) : Prop :=
  ∀ P : Predicate α, P s₁ ↔ P s₂

/-- Logical equivalence is an equivalence relation -/
theorem logical_equivalence_is_equivalence :
    Equivalence (@logically_equivalent α) :=
  ⟨fun _ _ => Iff.rfl,
   fun h P => (h P).symm,
   fun h₁₂ h₂₃ P => Iff.trans (h₁₂ P) (h₂₃ P)⟩

## Foundation for Future Development

This basic framework provides:
1. Precise definitions of the 3FLL
2. A notion of logical consistency for states
3. A definition of physical reality as logically consistent states

Next modules will:
- Add quantum structure (amplitudes, Hilbert spaces)
- Show how dynamics must preserve logical consistency
- Derive the Born rule and Schrödinger equation
- Prove uniqueness theorems for physical laws
