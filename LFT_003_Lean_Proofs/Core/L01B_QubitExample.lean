# Qubit System as a Concrete Example of Observable Determinacy

This module demonstrates the LFT framework with a concrete quantum system: a qubit.
We show how a spin-1/2 particle exhibits the key features of our framework:
- Determinate states (eigenstates) are in Physical Reality
- Superposition states have indeterminate observables
- Measurement forces determinacy (Stern-Gerlach experiment)

## Physical System
We model a spin-1/2 particle (qubit) with observables for spin along x, y, and z axes.
This connects directly to the Stern-Gerlach experiment and quantum computing.

## Connection to Stern-Gerlach Experiment

The Stern-Gerlach experiment demonstrates our framework perfectly:

1. **Initial State**: Silver atoms in superposition (plusState)
   - All spin components indeterminate
   - Not in Physical Reality (no definite measurement outcomes)

2. **Measurement**: Magnetic field along z-axis
   - Forces z-spin to become determinate
   - Collapses to either spinUpZ or spinDownZ
   - Now in Physical Reality (definite measurement outcome)

3. **Sequential Measurements**:
   - After measuring z-spin, x and y remain indeterminate
   - Measuring x-spin makes z-spin indeterminate again
   - Can't have all spins determinate (uncertainty principle)

This maps exactly to our framework:
- Physical Reality = states with determinate observables
- Measurement = forcing observables to become determinate
- Quantum constraint = not all observables can be simultaneously determinate
-/

/-- Stern-Gerlach measurement along z-axis -/
def sternGerlachZ (initial : QubitState) : QubitState :=
  if initial.spinZ = none then
    -- Measurement forces determinacy (we'd need probabilities for which outcome)
    spinUpZ  -- Simplified: just pick one outcome
  else
    initial  -- Already determinate

/-- After Stern-Gerlach, the state is in Physical Reality -/
theorem stern_gerlach_creates_reality (q : QubitState) :
    q.spinZ = none →
    (sternGerlachZ q).toState ∈ PhysicalReality qubitWorld := by
  intro h_none
  unfold sternGerlachZ
  simp [h_none]
  -- spinUpZ has determinate z-spin, so it's in Physical Reality
  sorry -- Technical proof

end SternGerlachConnection

## What Does Indeterminate Mean?

When `measurement hP s = none`, what does this mean for the truth value of P(s)?

When an observable is indeterminate (returns `none`):
1. **The predicate P(s) is FALSE** - the particle doesn't have that specific value
2. **But ¬P(s) might also be FALSE** - it doesn't have the opposite value either
3. **The observable simply doesn't have a definite value**

Example with our qubit:
- In plusState, "has spin up along z" is FALSE (no definite z-spin)
- But "has spin down along z" is also FALSE
- The z-spin is genuinely indeterminate

This is consistent with quantum mechanics:
- Before measurement, the particle doesn't have a definite spin value
- The question "what is its spin?" has no meaningful answer
- Measurement creates the definite value, not reveals a pre-existing one
-/

/-- Indeterminate observables mean the predicate is false -/
theorem indeterminate_means_false (q : QubitState) :
    q.spinZ = none →
    ¬(spinToPredicate (SpinObservable.Z true) q) ∧
    ¬(spinToPredicate (SpinObservable.Z false) q) := by
  intro h_none
  unfold spinToPredicate
  simp [h_none]

/-- But the Law of Excluded Middle still holds! -/
theorem excluded_middle_holds_for_indeterminate (q : QubitState) :
    q.spinZ = none →
    (spinToPredicate (SpinObservable.Z true) q ∨
     ¬spinToPredicate (SpinObservable.Z true) q) := by
  intro _
  -- This is always true by classical logic
  exact Classical.em _

## Summary

This concrete qubit example demonstrates:

1. **Physical System**: Spin-1/2 particle with three spin components
2. **Quantum Constraint**: Not all components can be simultaneously determinate
3. **Eigenstates**: States with one determinate component (in Physical Reality)
4. **Superposition**: States with no determinate components (not in Physical Reality)
5. **Measurement**: Forces components to become determinate (Stern-Gerlach)
6. **No Logic Violation**: Even indeterminate states satisfy Excluded Middle

The framework correctly captures quantum mechanics without claiming logic violations.
Observable indeterminacy is a physical constraint, not a logical paradox.
