# Quantum Observables and Indeterminacy

This module bridges L01's framework with quantum mechanics, showing how
quantum superposition corresponds to indeterminate observables.

## Core Principle
Superposition states have indeterminate observables, which keeps them out of Physical Reality until
measurement forces determinacy. Observable indeterminacy is a physical constraint, not a logical one.

## Main Definitions
- `QuantumState` - States with position and momentum components
- `BasicObservable` - Position and momentum observables
- `quantumWorld` - World where incompatible observables lead to indeterminacy

## Physical Interpretation

1. **Superposition and Logic**
   - Superposition states satisfy all laws of logic
   - They simply have indeterminate observables

2. **Measurement and Determinacy**
   - Logic is always preserved
   - Measurement forces observables to become determinate
   - This brings states into Physical Reality

3. **The uncertainty principle is about indeterminacy**
   - Position and momentum cannot both be determinate
   - This is a physical constraint, not a logical one
   - It emerges from the nature of quantum observables

4. **Physical Reality ⊂ All Possible States**
   - Not all mathematically describable states are physically real
   - Physical Reality = states with all observables determinate
   - Superposition states exist in the larger space but not Physical Reality
-/

/-- Measurement projects states into Physical Reality -/
theorem measurement_creates_determinacy (_obs : BasicObservable) :
    -- After measuring an observable, it becomes determinate
    -- This is the "collapse" of the wave function
    -- But it's about determinacy, not logic
    True := by
  trivial  -- Placeholder for the actual measurement postulate
