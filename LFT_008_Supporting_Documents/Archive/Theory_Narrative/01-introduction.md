# Abstract

Logic Field Theory (LFT) is a logic-first reformulation of quantum mechanics that derives its state structure and dynamics from the prescriptive nature of the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL).  
By treating logic as a causal filter on the formally describable information field $\mathcal{S}$, LFT identifies the admissible set $\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{L}(\mathcal{S})$ and shows that, under coherence preservation and symmetry constraints, the only viable representation of physically realizable states is a complex Hilbert space.  
This framework preserves the predictive formalism of QM while providing a logically grounded explanation for its structure, yielding falsifiable predictions about measurement outcomes and realizability thresholds.

# Introduction

Logic Field Theory (LFT) proposes that the structure and behavior of the physical world emerge from the prescriptive nature of logic itself. Rather than treating logic as a passive descriptive tool, LFT models it as an active constraint—one that shapes which information structures are physically realizable.

## Motivation

The project is driven by several converging lines of reasoning:

- **Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR)** argued that quantum mechanics (QM), as formulated, is incomplete. LFT seeks to formalize that intuition, showing that QM’s formalism can be preserved while its foundations are reinterpreted in a logic-first framework.
- In current physics, admissibility criteria for physical states are often implicit or postulated ad hoc. LFT makes these criteria explicit by deriving them from the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL).
- By reframing the origin of quantum structure as a consequence of logical admissibility, LFT aims to unify classical and quantum descriptions within a single, deterministic framework.

## "How Come the Quantum?"

Physicist John Archibald Wheeler famously asked, *“How come the quantum?”*—why is reality built on quantum structure at all, rather than something else?  
LFT’s answer is that quantum mechanics is not an arbitrary overlay on nature, but the **minimal admissible state-and-dynamics formalism** consistent with the 3FLL.  
When the information field $\mathcal{S}$ is filtered through $\mathbb{L}$ to form $\mathcal{A}$, the geometry and algebra that emerge under coherence preservation and symmetry constraints yield a complex Hilbert space as the only viable representation for physically realizable states.  
In this view, the quantum is the logical endgame of admissibility—not a mysterious add-on.

## Core Hypothesis

LFT models reality as a five-stage execution pipeline:

1. **$\mathcal{S}$** — Formally describable information field (syntactic space).
2. **$\mathbb{L}$** — Logic-enforcement operator applying the 3FLL to $\mathcal{S}$.
3. **$\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{L}(\mathcal{S})$** — Logically permissible reality (admissible configurations).
4. **Probabilistic instantiation** — Assigns realization weights to elements of $\mathcal{A}$ via the logical strain functional $D(\psi)$.
5. **Collapse or null outcome** — Physical realization occurs if $\exp(-\beta D(\psi)) \ge \varepsilon$.

**Session 1 clarification:**  
The admissible set $\mathcal{A}$ contains all configurations that satisfy logical constraints.  
The strain functional $D(\psi)$ is *not* part of $\mathcal{A}$’s definition—strain only enters at the probabilistic instantiation stage.  
This separation ensures that logical admissibility and physical realizability remain distinct.
