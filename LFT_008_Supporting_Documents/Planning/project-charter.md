## 1. Purpose & Vision
Logic Field Theory (LFT) seeks to derive the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics directly from the **Three Fundamental Laws of Logic** (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle), without assuming unproven physical postulates.  
The goal is a fully rigorous, Lean 4â€“verified derivation that explains the emergence of quantum and classical behavior from logically admissible information states.

## 2. Core Hypothesis
$$ \Omega = \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{S}) $$
Observable reality is the logically admissible subset (Î©) of all syntactically valid information patterns (S), produced by the logic-enforcing operator â„’.

## 3. Conceptual Roadmap
1. **Pure Logic** â€“ Start with the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL).  
2. **Pre-Quantum Graph Mathematics** â€“ Propositions as vertices, entailment as edges, admissibility defined via 3FLL constraints.  
3. **Information Theory & Logical Strain** â€“ Quantify admissibility cost via $v_I$, $v_N$, $v_E$.  
4. **Complex Field Necessity** â€“ Justify â„‚-valued state space from graph-theoretic logic.  
5. **Quantum Dynamics Framework** â€“ Derive unitarity, Born rule, decoherence, and measurement thresholds.

## 4. Deliverables
- **Theory Narrative** (`docs/theory-v5`) â€“ Formal prose exposition.
- **Formal Derivations** (`docs/derivations-v5`) â€“ Step-by-step proofs.
- **Lean 4 Mapping** (`lean-map`) â€“ Linking theory sections to Lean formalization tasks.
- **Historical Papers** (`docs/position-papers`) â€“ Archived versions and PDFs.

---

## 5. Validation Plan
- Complete Born rule and dynamics derivations within theory & Lean.
- Develop falsifiable strain-based predictions.
- Coordinate with experimental physicists for potential testing.
