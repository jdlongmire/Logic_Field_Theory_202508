## 1. Executive Summary

Logic Field Theory (LFT) is a foundational physics research program proposing that the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) serve as the primitive structure from which quantum mechanics necessarily emerges. This project aims to formally derive, experimentally validate, and philosophically ground this framework through rigorous mathematical proofs, targeted experiments, and scholarly publication.

## 2. Project Vision & Mission

### Vision
To demonstrate that the mathematical structures of physics emerge from logical necessity rather than contingent selection, potentially resolving longstanding questions about why quantum mechanics takes its specific form.

### Mission
To develop, formalize, and test a complete derivation of quantum mechanics from pure logic plus minimal physical assumptions, creating a new foundation for understanding physical reality.

## 3. Project Objectives

4. **Publish findings** in peer-reviewed physics and philosophy journals
5. **Build collaborative network** of researchers across disciplines
