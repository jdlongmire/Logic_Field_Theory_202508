- D02 → CircleAction.lean (S¹ action; real exclusion; quaternionic exclusion)
- D03 → Dynamics.lean (Wigner lemma; Stone theorem usage)
- D04 → Gleason.lean (projection valuation → Tr(ρP); Busch extension)
- D05 → Hilbert.lean (ℓ²(𝒜,ℂ) construction)
- D06 → Measurement.lean (timing policy abstraction)
